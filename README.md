Dead simple secret key generator for my Flask apps, mbicos I'm dead lazy. 

### ADDED: ###

An attendant Flask app. YAY!  

- cd into `app` 
- Run `flask run` - the environment variables have alredy been set in `.env`, with 7095 as the default port  

### Additional Improvemements ###
- Refresh only the div which displays the secret key - JavaScript implementation
